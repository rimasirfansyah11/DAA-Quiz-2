Based on Dijkstra’s History: What is the shortest way to travel from Rotterdam to Groningen, 
in general: from given city to given city. It is the algorithm for the shortest path, which I 
designed in about twenty minutes. One morning I was shopping in Amsterdam with my young fiancée, 
and tired, we sat down on the café terrace to drink a cup of coffee and I was just thinking about 
whether I could do this, and I then designed the algorithm for the shortest path. As I said, it was 
a twenty-minute invention. In fact, it was published in ’59, three years late. The publication is 
still readable; it is, in fact, quite nice. One of the reasons that it is so nice was that I designed 
it without pencil and paper. I learned later that one of the advantages of designing without pencil 
and paper is that you are almost forced to avoid all avoidable complexities. Eventually that algorithm 
became, to my great amazement, one of the cornerstones of my fame. — Edsger Dijkstra, in an interview
with Philip L. Frana, Communications of the ACM, 2001.
